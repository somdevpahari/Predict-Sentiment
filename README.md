## Project: Analysing Restaurant Reviews (NLP)
### Install
You can do the project either with [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [R-4.1.0](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). It will be easier if you use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html) for Python or [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for R. For Python you need to be installed the following libraries:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Background
In this example, we are going to analyze reviews from a restaurant using Bag-Of-Words Model. After that we can predict a new review either positive or negative.

### Code
Code files are there with `.ipynb`, `.py` and `.R` extension. You can simply open and run them with corresponding software mentioned above.

### Data
The `.tsv` file contains the reviews and corresponding like or dislike associated with them.
